# advent of code 2022

I was inspired to do this by [t3.gg](https://t3.gg/). I'm going to try to do all the puzzles in TypeScript. I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'm going to try to do all of them.

## Day 1

I love elves! I love elves so much! I love elves so much that I'm going to do all the puzzles in TypeScript. I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'm going to try to do all of them. Thanks for the help, copilot! You should be my friend! I just went to hell and back trying to install Deno because t3 uses it. Smh.

## Day 2

Checking in on day 2. Copilot is not my friend anymore. I have disabled it for these challenges.

## Day 3

It is wild how one simple mistake can cascade to such a mess. Watching the world cup this morning alongside my elf friends. USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ lost. Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡· will hopefully move on.

## Day 4

Argentina moved on. Day 4 check in, things are going well! 477.
