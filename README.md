# advent of code 2022

I was inspired to do this by [t3.gg](https://t3.gg/). I'm going to try to do all the puzzles in TypeScript. I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'm going to try to do all of them.

## Day 1

I love elves! I love elves so much! I love elves so much that I'm going to do all the puzzles in TypeScript. I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'm going to try to do all of them. Thanks for the help, copilot! You should be my friend! I just went to hell and back trying to install Deno because t3 uses it. Smh.
